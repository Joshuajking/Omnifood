# Omnifood
 ### website done in HTML CSS & JS
 <p>Based on a representation of an online food retailer. Omnifood brings design and functionality, providing customers with a graceful layout, menu options and a subscription plan for healthy eating. Showcasing products and cities with the option of mobile apps (not functional).
I created this site using HTML/CSS and JavaScript, focusing heavily on CSSâ€™s many properties to provide elegant transitions. This site was created with the guidance of an online tutorial to dive deeper into website development and the possibilities of CSS.</p>
<p>This project is being used to implment features into my main project [MarketWatch](https://github.com/Joshuajking/MarketWatch-git)</p>
